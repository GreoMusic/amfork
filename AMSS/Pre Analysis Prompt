	Analyzing the Effectiveness of Highstrike

Analyzing The Effectiveness of Highstrike
Highstrike is an educational trading company established in 2018 by Benjamin Zogby. In
2018, Benjamin was managing and operating the company by himself. He was operating as
fulfillment, sales, customer support, and CEO. Since 2018, Benjamin has dedicated his life to
optimizing the company's growth. According to Kiniki (2012), synergy is the idea that two or
more forces combined create an effect that is greater than the sum of their individual effects.”
Highstrike has about ten employees acquired through the success of the trading program.
Although the company size remains small, it has increased its brand awareness. The main issue
that Highstrike has encountered was prematurely promoting a marketing manager without proper
training and support to the chief executive officer, which has affected business operations.
Open Systems
The four components of a system are inputs, transformational processes, outputs, and
feedback. The inputs going into the company are the educational content, qualified employees,
learning resources, and technology equipment. Highstrike invests learning resources, such as
books, conferences, and software, in their qualified employees because they recognize their
employee's value. Highstrike inputs money into Discord, a communicating platform, brokerage
accounts, and Thinkorswim software. The second component of the open system is a
transformational process that includes instructional delivery, interactive learning, assessment and
evaluation, and adaptation to a variety of customers. The content is distributed to a customer
once they’ve paid for the trading course. The customer has lifetime access to the course content
through the website. Within the course, the student receives lectures, discussion boards, and
practical assessments to prepare customers for stock trading. The third component of an open
system is output. Highstrike’s output is demonstrated through its skilled customers, certificates
for customers, and employee retention. One of the biggest forms of output for Highstrike is its
customer success stories. Customers usually have little to no trading experience, therefore
Highstrike aims to create content that is easy to consume for customers. If customers fail to
understand the material then Highstrike doesn’t obtain their desired output. Additionally,
Highstrike’s excellent employee retention is a desired output because they heavily invest their
resources in employees. The final component is the feedback section. Highstrike warmly accepts
customer and employee feedback. Additionally, positive feedback is demonstrated through an
increase in return on investments. Since Highstrike is a trading company it is essential to monitor
industry changes. Highstrike’s adaptability describes an open system which tends to be an
indicator of success.
Management Viewpoints and Approaches
Behavioral Viewpoint- Human relations
In regards to the issue of prematurely promoting an employee, customers have
unknowingly been affected. The current unqualified CEO is not properly overseeing employees
and is not providing feedback. Without proper feedback, employees underperform the quality of
the educational trading content for the customers. According to Smith (1983), “The job of
management then would become one of providing the directions and means to allow both
customers and employees to experience the highest level of hierarchy.” The highest level of
hierarchy is self-actualization, which provides security for the employee's customer service
skills. The human relations movement can be applied to solve the issue by instructing and
offering training to the unqualified CEO. Employees at Highstrike view their CEO as a Theory X
employee because of their operating decisions. A theory X employee has tendencies to be
irresponsible, lack ambition and need constant supervision. Customers might not notice the
change in management as early as employees, but if the CEO does not receive support in training
it will affect customers directly. If the CEO does not receive proper training, it will lead to an
increase in poor employee engagement, inconsistent service quality, and negative public image.
Therefore, it is imperative for Highstrike to offer additional training to the unqualified employee
or to hire a qualified employee who has theory Y tendencies and aims for self-actualization in
employees and customers.
Contemporary approaches Viewpoint- learning organization
In regards to the issue of prematurely promoting a marketing manager to CEO, other
employees are being negatively affected. Highstrike is a company that values its employees'
learning process, but management has overlooked their employees concerning the current CEO.
Although no one has verbally spoken up about the current CEO lacking the necessary skills to
lead and direct, the company is starting to financially suffer. Some employees might be scared to
communicate with board members, others might not want to embarrass the CEO, and others
might feel their feedback is not valued. Highstrike can utilize the learning organization's
contemporary viewpoint to enhance employee lack of vision, limited ability to excel, and
resentment buildup. Highstrike should promote a culture of continuous learning, including but
not limited to the CEO. By constantly promoting growth, employees will receive a sense of
self-actualization, and the business will have greater employee assets. Additionally, Highstrike
can promote a culture of communication and transparency regarding higher management.
Employees should be able to anonymously reach out to higher management without feeling fear
of reprisal. Employees should not feel incorrect about offering feedback to the CEO because
everyone makes mistakes, and everyone needs to receive feedback. Overall, Highstrike needs to
embrace a culture of learning and employee development to aid business success.
Quantitative Viewpoint- operations management
In regards to the issue of prematurely promoting an employee, board members are
directly affected by the profitability and business operations. As mentioned above, Highstrike is
a trading company that is inclined to fluctuate due to external factors. Highstrike’s operation
performance has decreased in members enticed to subscribe and fellows enrolled. The number of
sales call bookings has decreased from 6-8 a day to 2-3 a day. Additionally, the company has
experienced a net break-even profit to loss, which has not happened before. Highstrike can
utilize operations management to solve the issue by offering training to the unqualified CEO or
replacing the current CEO. The board members at Highstrike can begin identifying the key
performance indicators that impact profitability. As mentioned above, KPIs include student
enrollment, and customer and employee satisfaction. The second step includes using data
analytics to compare and contrast the CEO’s operational decisions with the operational metrics.
For example, the business could have experienced a brief loss due to seasonal and market
changes, but it relies on the CEO to improve business strategies to optimize growth. The next
step includes conducting a cost-benefit analysis to determine if the CEO’s expenses are
correlated with profitability. The last step serves as a reflection of the prior steps. Highstrike
board members can retain their current CEO, but implement operational management tools to
determine if the employee is fit for the role. If after using the operational management tools, data
reveals the CEO is not fit for the role they must decide to provide additional training or replace
the CEO to improve profitability.
Evaluation of the Decision-Making Process
After analyzing the different management viewpoints and approaches Highstrike has, we
can effectively evaluate their decision-making process and nonrational. A non-rational
decision-making model suggests that Highstrike operates without having complete information
about a situation and is influenced by emotions, biases, and heuristics. The company was bought
from the founder, and the buyer demanded a new CEO promptly. This hindrance is a form of
time, money, and value constraints. The company wasn’t extremely profitable when it was
bought, therefore, they needed to promote someone within the company. Additionally, The
current CEO serves as a good mediator and has extensive experience in therapy, but from a
technical business standpoint, they lack the essential skills for the role. The satisficing model and
bounded rationality model fit this issue best. Unfortunately, Highstrike felt rushed by investors
and board members to appoint a new CEO with minimal information, time, and money. As a
result of making a non-rational decision, the company is now declining in profitability and brand
presence.
Artificial Intelligence
Highstrike is a trading company that embraces constant change and technological
innovations. Artificial intelligence is starting to become prevalent in the trading industry, but for
the issue presented, predictive analytics with AI would have avoided the issue. Bhattacharya
(2023), stated, “The study focuses on recognizing the prime attributes that help decide which
employees may be promoted and LIME and SHAP contribute to achieving this.” For context,
LIME and SHAP are two software within the XAI technologies. Predictive analytics with AI for
employee promotion is a prevalent field that has demonstrated accuracy. Highstrike would first
need to implement an evidence-based management approach and pair those results with AI
predictive analytics. If Highstrike was to utilize this form of AI then it would remove any biases
when evaluating the current CEO. One of the issues with using predictive analytics with AI
might be its lack of knowledge of an employee's intangible assets. For example, the current CEO
is an honest, hardworking, with extensive knowledge in therapy. Highstrike offers their
employees and customers access to therapy sessions with the CEO. Since AI would not be able
to account for those soft skills it could also make a harmful decision. This AI tool could be used
for all four levels of management. Highstrike has about ten employees who could also be
evaluated using the tool to ensure the company is optimizing its resources. The board members
are the top level and the CEO serves as the middle manager. The first-line managers include the
sales manager and fulfillment manager. The team leaders are those directly having one call for
sales. Highstrike is hiring more team leaders and the predictive analytics tool using AI could
make the hiring process faster and cheaper. Overall, Highstrike could implement predictive
analytics with AI with caution, as do many other companies, regarding the hiring and employee
retention process.
Goals
As mentioned above, Highstrike is a good company that has recently prematurely promoted an
employee to CEO based on a non-rational decision-making process. For Highstrike to regain
profitability they need to implement long and short-term SMART goals. A short-term goal would
be to provide the unqualified CEO with training and mentorship or replace them with a qualified
CEO. Both options fall under the SMART goals because they are specific, measurable,
attainable, result-oriented, and target-dated. Both options require Highstrike to invest money.
Highstrike values employee history, therefore, they would opt to keep the current CEO. If they
keep the current CEO, Highstrike needs to provide mentorship and training for three months.
After the six months, they could give them a two-month trial and monitor business outputs. The
other option includes demoting the current CEO to a marketing manager and hiring a qualified
CEO outside of the company. The hiring process could last about three months with additional
training and mentorship to immerse the new CEO of Highstrike's culture and policies. A
long-term goal would be to implement a better leadership and operational system to avoid having
conflicts with CEOs. As I was writing this paper, I noticed operational flaws that are harming the
business. Highstrike needs to hire people outside of their success stories. If they restructure the
company and only keep employees who have theory Y tendencies they could increase their
opportunities. The long-term goal would take about two years for a seamless transition. The
long-term goal could be measured by profitability, employee and customer satisfaction, and
brand awareness.
Conclusion
Functions of Management
As a result of prematurely hiring an unqualified employee to CEO, the company has begun to
face hardships and will continue unless Highstrike implements predictive analytics AI along with
the short and long-term goals. Highstrike needs to establish clear expectations, develop a training
plan assign mentors, and monitor progress for the current CEO. If Highstrike chooses to replace
the current CEO they need to begin recruitment, develop a transition plan, and monitor the
progress of the future CEO. Overall Highstrike needs to execute a culture where feedback and
improvement are encouraged to obtain a better organized company.
