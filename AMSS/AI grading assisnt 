Analyzing The Effectiveness of Safeway
Any major company or organization will certainly have its fair share of controversy or issues within the workplace, and it is the management's job to figure out the ideal solution to solve them and return to a healthy work environment. When these issues arise, certain areas should be addressed within the managerial department to see what job the manager possesses in dealing with the issue and how certain viewpoints, approaches, evaluations, or even hypothetical ideas can be used to fix the problem. A company’s management team can work efficiently at settling an issue through the implementation of an open system, approaching the issue from a management viewpoint, evaluating the decisions toward the issue, and pondering if hypotheticals, such as artificial intelligence, can be used to figure out any issues in the future of the company.
Safeway is a chain of supermarkets that can be predominantly found throughout the West Coast and Southwest of the United States; however, there are several other locations scattered throughout the country (Safeway). The Safeway that will be discussed today is in San Jose, California, and the issue that was present at this location was one of the employees working as a registered sex offender in the state of California. This took place over the summer of 2020, specifically in May. It is not confirmed when the sexual assault took place, but it was discovered by the management team during this period. This issue caused unrest within the work environment among the other employees because the employee who committed the crime was considered a friend and loyal worker, so it came as a shock to hear about what he had done. It also raised questions about how well the background checks were being completed and caused suspicion to arise about whether any other employees had committed crimes that were going undetected.

Open Systems
The four components of an open system are inputs, transformational systems, outputs, and feedback; an open system is also regarded as a company that interacts continually with its environment and can operate with synergy (McGraw Hill, pg. 37). The inputs for Safeway include food products, medicinal products, suppliers for these products, employees, and many other items and services. The transformational processes for Safeway include things such as inventory tracking, delivery trucks, the Safeway mobile app and website, and other things that help convert inputs to outputs. The outputs that come from Safeway are packaged food and drink products, lifestyle products, medicine/pharmaceutical products, and essentially everything that the store sells or offers as a good or service. Safeway receives large amounts of feedback from customers and higher-ups within the company that are all considered for the bettering of the store location. Regarding the issue that happened at the location selected, some moments displayed this specific store not acting as an open system. In terms of engaging with the environment, this store had a separate team of hiring staff that was not fully associated with Safeway, and this hiring group did not go through the hiring process with careful consideration and would not complete extensive background checks on possible employee, which in turn led to the hiring of a sex offender. Had Safeway done the hiring process themselves, or had they chosen a more reliable team of people to take over this area for them, this incident would more than likely not have happened. There were times during this issue when Safeway had acted well as an open system, and possibly increased the synergy within the environment of the workplace. After the incident had occurred and the employee was fired, the management staff stepped up the hiring of new employees and in turn brought a greater feeling of security to the work environment which allowed everyone to work more efficiently, as there was a greater sense of comradery with employees that allowed for them to work together and affect each other positively.
Management Viewpoints and Approaches. 

 
Customer Viewpoint
Using Spaulding's Administrative Management from a classical viewpointP is the best way that Safeway can review and handle the situation. The customers are the ones who get to review their shopping experience and provide feedback. That feedback will influence how Safeway can prevent future situations like this and help compensate for the situation that has already occurred. 
Employee Viewpoint
Using operations management from a quantitative viewpoint to look over how many cases and allegations have been reported nationally. Getting those statistical numbers can help them to provide resources and be more aware for future encounters with sex offenders. Realizing the importance of background checks and conducting interviews can help the middle level managers know who they are hiring. 
Managerial Viewpoint
Not only does this affect the customers and other employees who worked closely with the sex offenders, but it affects all levels of management. The complexity theory helps each person to understand how deep this issue can really go. The system's viewpoint engages all people to resolve the situation through determining the next course of action and ways to prevent this from happening in the future. 
Evaluation of the Decision-Making Process 
	When coming to the decision process, there can be a rational or non-rational for the decision process. The rational decision process is where the decision is carefully considered and negative outcomes are weighed while nonrational decisions are based on intuitive judgement (Hernandez, 2015, para.6). When it comes to the decision of Safeway firing the employee due to him being a sex offender, the management took the rational decision process. The first step in the decision process is hearing that one of your employees is a sex offender, this would be the foundation. Before making any decision on what to do, the next step would do research. When it comes to sex offenders, they are made to be public and can find them online. Doing research would be step two. From what you found out from research, the next step to the rational process would be to talk to the employee. When it comes to meeting with the employee, the last thing you want to do as a manger is to blame and yell at him. In the scenario with Safeway, the case was that management fired the employee over this as there is a chance he lied to them while being hired. 
	The rational decision process is mostly used to make logical decisions that is all based off of the information you receive. The limitations that come from the rational process is ignoring the employee’s emotions and cognitive biases (LinkedIn, 2024, para.1). Cognitive bias is where you take mental shortcuts that influence your evaluation of the process. Overall, the decision process of firing this employee was all based on the rational decision process.
Artificial Intelligence 
Artificial Intelligence is one of the biggest influences in our world right now. The amount of work and ideas that artificial intelligence can do for you is way more than we could have predicted. One of the biggest ways that Artificial intelligence can help is through decision making. Artificial Intelligence can be used to help with the decision process as it evaluates the data and the variables in a complex situation (Upwork, 2023, para.1). During the decision process of the safeway employee, using AI to help see if the decision you are going to make is the right decision based on the variables and data can be helpful. It can help make the decision process easier for management as you fully state what happened and what you should do.
 (ABBY) The AI recommendation of using artificial intelligence for improving decision making for Safeway. An example of this could be new programming for top managers to identify what big opportunities to pursue. This could mean weather or not to open a new store, which items to have on shelves, etc. The top managers adopt the AI insights across the organization for strategic decision making. Middle managers are a bridge between the top managers and front line. They can implement new decision-making technology through training and change in the workplace. The middle managers can use AI through different training strategies and use it to aid in employee evaluations. First line managers oversee day-to-day operations. They use decision making AI to promote collaboration and learning. Using this can improve cross-function teamwork, creating an easier way to share knowledge and increase innovation within a workplace. For example, they could use AI to decide what times of the day are least busy and what tasks to get done thorughout the day. Nonmanagerial employees use decision making AI through being able to identify pain points easier. Nonmanagerial employees have firsthand  experience to the operation inefficiencies. Using AI to decide what the pain-points are and how to solve them would increase daily workflow. This could mean using AI to identify what times of the week are most prone to theft and implement new operations on those days. A remedy could be adding another staff member to that shift. 

Goals
Creating goals is vital to completing various weaknesses within an organization. One thing I’ve noticed when shopping at Safeway is their organization. Typically, with how they organize what food is next to another. Sometimes it can take you 5-10 minutes just to find one item. A short-term Goal for Safeway could be using AI to reorganize the store. As we mentioned above, AI is a powerful and useful tool that uses data analytics and trends to make thought-out solutions. Within Six months Safeway can work together with AI software to organize the store in a way that shoppers can find things through natural intuition. As people we develop common sense, on where we expect things to be. I will say not everyone has the same thought process when it comes to organization, but AI can use data to discover what the best middle ground is. Like including pasta sauce next to pasta, ETC. A long-term goal that Safeway can begin working on is automated check-out. If you’ve ever had the opportunity to go to Climate Pledge Arena located in Seattle, Washington. They have automated sensors and triggers that register what Items are leaving the store without ever having to press a button. Customers use “tap” on their credit cards to get there information into the system, then customers can shop around freely, pick out what they want, and leave without having to wait in line to check-out. They simply can walk in and out freely without ever having to stop moving. Within 2 years Safeway can make this an option for customers, so the hassle of waiting in line to pay for your groceries can come to an end. This will influence shoppers to continue shopping there due to the convenience. 
Conclusion
Functions of Management – Josh Reimer
            In conclusion, a company’s management team can work efficiently at settling an issue through the implementation of acting as an open system, approaching the issue from a management viewpoint, evaluating the decisions toward the issue, and pondering if hypotheticals, such as Artificial Intelligence, can be used to figure out any issues in the future of the company. It is management's responsibility to prevent these issues from happening and should be held accountable, this rare but real scenario that it does happen. Safeway leads its company from a servant leadership perspective in hopes of being an example of how to run a company the right way (Cumming, 1994). We can see this in how they handled the sexual assault situation. Before letting go of the offender, they had a discussion with him and encouraged him to seek help immediately at a local place in the bay area. Safeway is a company that holds its employees to a high standard and has shown proactive steps in preventing future offenses through asserting control. Safeway tightened up on its employee training seminars, promotion of reporting channels, investigation and response protocols, promotion of respect and decency cultures. This is how Safeway leads, organizes, and controls its atmosphere post 2020 sexual assault event. Safeways states that it is, “to be the preferred shopping choice of our customers and the employer of choice in our communities by delivering outstanding value, continuous innovation, exceptional customer experience where service, value, and trust are part of the experience” (2024).
