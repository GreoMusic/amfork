## **üöÄ Real-World Impact**

### **Before (Teacher Only Sees Final Result):**
```
Teacher sees: "The character was heartbroken because he lost his best friend..."
Teacher thinks: "Good improvement, but I don't know how they got there."
```

### **After (Teacher Sees Full Process):**
```
Teacher sees: 
- Original: "The character was sad because he lost his dog."
- LISA's help: "Consider adding more emotional detail..."
- Student's response: "Thanks! I'll make it more emotional."
- Result: "The character was heartbroken because he lost his best friend..."

Teacher thinks: "LISA helped John with descriptive writing. 
                He responded positively and made significant improvements. 
                I should focus more on emotional detail in my lessons."
```
